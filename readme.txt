SkyCast
=======
A disruptive new weather data startup, SkyCast Inc., reached out to you for your help with a small development 
project. They are looking to change the way people read weather forecasts and would like a stable base to iterate 
from.


APIs to Use
=======
SkyCast is looking to leverage a weather API (https://developer.forecast.io) combined with a geolocation API (https:/
/developers.google.com/maps) to allow users to retrieve current as well as historic data about any location that the 
users search.


Requirements:
=======
- SkyCast would like their users to be able to enter in any location and retrieve current and useful information 
about the weather in that area, as well as a future forecast.
- Include charts for historic weather information about that area using any visualization library of your choice, 
allowing the user to see relevant information within a reasonable time period.
- Additionally, the team feels that allowing a user to track his or her search history would be a valuable addition, 
and would like to see a way of storing queries made by a specific user between browser sessions.


Style
=======
Since the project is a prototype, SkyCast looks to you for integrating usable designs and best practices in terms of 
look and feel into your application. They will also be looking to do a walkthrough of your code with you to gauge 
how extensible your codebase can be.


Submission
=======
For your assignment, create an application that satisfies the requirements as listed. Please host the application on 
a platform of your choice except Github, and make sure it is available and runs from any browser. Package your 
source code and submit it in its entirety. If the requirements are unclear, feel free to reach out with any 
questions, but do realize this exercise is a chance for you to show us your abilities to turn requirements into 
features.


[BONUS] Although not required, the SkyCast team has been looking into various technologies and is interested in 
practical examples of how to leverage some of them. These include Javascript application frameworks, Javascript 
testing suites, and resource pre-compilers.
